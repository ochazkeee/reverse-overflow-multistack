# Comparison of Multiple Stack Structures

## Overview

This document compares several approaches to implementing multiple stacks within a single memory space.  
The proposed **Reverse Overflow** structure is evaluated alongside traditional methods  
in terms of **space efficiency**, **time complexity**, **flexibility**, and **implementation trade-offs**.

Note: This comparison focuses on array-based or classical multi-stack implementations, excluding specialized niche structures.

## Compared Structures

1. **Fixed Partitioning**
2. **Dynamic Resizing**
3. **Linked Stack (Knuth’s approach)**
4. **Reverse Overflow (Proposed Structure)**

---

## 1. Fixed Partitioning

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Structure** | A single array is evenly divided into *n* fixed-size regions, one per stack |
| **Pros** | Very simple to implement, no interference between stacks |
| **Cons** | Severe space waste if stacks are imbalanced; unused space remains locked |
| **Time Complexity** | O(1) (push/pop) |
| **Flexibility** | Very low |

---

## 2. Dynamic Resizing

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Each stack resizes its region as needed, often requiring array reorganization |
| **Pros** | Space can be reallocated dynamically and used more efficiently |
| **Cons** | Requires expensive operations (copying, relocating) during resizing |
| **Time Complexity** | Average O(1), Worst-case O(n) (on resize) |
| **Flexibility** | Moderate |

## 3. Linked Stack (Knuth’s Approach)

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Linked list representation: each node points to the next, no array required |
| **Pros** | Space grows dynamically, no wasted array space |
| **Cons** | Pointer overhead per node, potential for cache misses, more complex implementation |
| **Time Complexity** | O(1) (push/pop) |
| **Space Overhead** | High (per-node pointer) |
| **Flexibility** | High |

> ⚠ Linked stacks may suffer from **low cache locality** in large-scale systems due to scattered memory access.

## 4. Reverse Overflow (Proposed Structure)

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Structure** | A single fixed-size array shared by all stacks;  
each stack can grow beyond its base area by "reverse overflowing" into adjacent stack space |
| **Pros** | Very high space efficiency, no global resizing needed, cache-friendly, supports dynamic sharing |
| **Cons** | Requires owner tracking and overflow reclaim logic; non-trivial to implement |
| **Time Complexity** | Average O(1), Worst-case O(k) (when scanning across *k* stacks for space) |
| **Flexibility** | Very high |
| **Overhead** | Requires metadata (e.g., owner array or index map) for element tracking |

| **Overhead**         | None               | Resizing cost           | Pointer overhead      | Owner tracking cost     |

## Conclusion

The **Reverse Overflow** structure shows strong advantages in  
- **cache locality**,  
- **space efficiency**,  
- and **runtime flexibility**.

Unlike linked stacks, it does not rely on pointers.  
Unlike dynamic resizing, it avoids costly array reallocations.  
It instead enables dynamic stack growth within a **single static array**,  
by allowing overflow into adjacent stack areas in a controlled, reversible manner.

With proper tracking (e.g., an owner index array or map),  
it maintains performance without sacrificing cache friendliness,  
making it a **practical and innovative approach** for multi-stack scenarios  
— especially when memory space is fixed or limited.
